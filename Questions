Q1. Find the output for this code. Let input:- 2 3 6
#include
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x;
cout << "Enter first number\n";
cin >> x; // user will give ‘x’ a value.
int y, m;
cout << "Enter second number and value for taking modulus\n";
cin >> y >> m; // user will give ‘y’ a value.
int Z = (x * y) % m;
cout << "Output is: " << Z;
}
Output
Enter first number
2
Enter second number value for taking modulus
3 6
Output is: 0
( Firstly 3*2 will be calculated which is 6 then 6%6 which will return remainder as 0. )
Q2. Find the output for this code. Let input:- 3 2
#include
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x;
cout<<"Enter first number\n";
cin>>x; // user will give 'x' a value.
int y;
cout<<"Enter second number\n";
cin>>y; // user will give 'y' a value.
cout<<(x!=y)<<" "<<(x>=y);
}
Output
Enter first number
3
Enter second number
2
1 1
( It will return 1 1 because in first x is not equal to y so it will return true value which is 1 secondly x is greater than y which is also true so it will again return 1. )
Q3. Find the output for this code. Let input:- 2 3
#include
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x,y;
cin>>x>>y;
x+=y;
x-=y;
x%=y;
cout<<x;
}
Output
2
( If taken x = 2 and y = 3 )

cout<<i;
}
Output
49
